## Hi there 👋

I’m Parnia, a software engineering student interested in learning how to build software tools. Right now I am mostly creating projects to build my skills and get more comfortable with different tools and technologies.

## What I’m working on
- Small web apps and backend services to practice full-stack development  
- Course projects that focus on C, Java, and problem-solving  
- Personal projects (like campus tools) to solve everyday problems and learn by doing
  
## Tools I use
- Languages: Python, Java, C, JavaScript  
- Web: React, HTML, CSS  
- Backend: FastAPI and simple REST APIs  
- Other: Git, GitHub, basic SQL, Linux
