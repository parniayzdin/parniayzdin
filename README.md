## Hi there 👋

I’m Parnia, a software engineering student interested in learning how to build software tools. Right now I am mostly creating projects to build my skills and get more comfortable with different tools and technologies.

I mostly work on small web apps and backend services to practice full-stack development. I am also strengthening my skills in C, Java, and Python through my course projects.
  
I work with web technologies such as React, HTML, and CSS, and backend tools like FastAPI and simple REST APIs to create my projects.

<p><sub>I’m always looking for ways to improve and learn from new projects and experiences. 🌱</sub></p>
