## Hi there 👋

I’m Parnia, a software engineering student interested in learning how to build software tools. Right now I am mostly creating projects to build my skills and get more comfortable with different tools and technologies.

I mostly work on small web apps and backend services to practice full-stack development. 
I am also enhancing my skills in C, Java and Python through course projects. 
  
Tools I use
- Languages: Python, Java, C, JavaScript  
- Web: React, HTML, CSS  
- Backend: FastAPI and simple REST APIs  
- Other: Git, GitHub, basic SQL, Linux
